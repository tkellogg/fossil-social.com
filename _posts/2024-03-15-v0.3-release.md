Fossil is a Mastodon client with an algorithm for displaying posts according to their 
content. It's an algorithm, but it's not your typical social media
algorithm. Engagement (likes, boosts, views) doesn't factor in at all. Only the content
of the post itself is used. Fossil digs through your timeline and finds the posts you
wish you saw before.


## Website & App
The main focus of this release was fossil as a service. If you elect to go this route,
you can pay $4/month and have an always-available web app. This addresses issues around
fossil being a little tricky to setup, as well as being able to easily access from a
phone (e.g. if the server is running on a laptop).

## Improvements
Lots of bugfixes & improvements.

* New look & feel. Re-wrote the header part of the website, now with a real SVG hamburger menu instead of a literal hamburger üçî emoji. Also, a new SVG logo and new display for settings pages.
* Lots of new hooks for plugins
* Local stability improvement ‚Äî¬†Store cache in `~/.cache` instead of a temp directory. Some operating systems periodically clear temp files, which put the server into an invalid state until the server was restarted. Meaning that you had to periodically restart the server to keep it functioning. That's fixed now.
* Resolve issue #6: Publish package on PyPi by @baseely in [#22](https://github.com/tkellogg/fossil/pull/22)

As always, please let me know about your wishlist features!
