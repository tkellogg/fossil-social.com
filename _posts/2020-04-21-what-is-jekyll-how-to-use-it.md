It shouldn't take a lot of effort to stay up to date with industry news. You used to be
able to read headlines out of a single journal to keep track of what's happening in your
industry. But then a lot of the information moved online into social media networks and
it got harder to keep track of trends.

Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc. all have timeline algorithms that decide what you see 
and when. These are optimized for keeping you glued to the app. The longer they keep
you doomscroolling, the more ad revenue they'll get.

Fossil is also a timeline algorithm, but instead optimizes for your time by highlighting
interesting content and letting you ignore everything else. It does that by grouping 
similar posts together:
