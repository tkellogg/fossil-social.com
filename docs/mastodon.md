Mastodon is a social network similar to Twitter/X, Threads, or Bluesky with posts being mostly short
text but also other media. 

## Is it free?
Unlike the other social networks, Mastodon servers are run by regular unpaid
volunteers. Most servers don't charge you money, but many will request that you pitch in a few dollars,
if you can. Some might outright charge money (typically co-ops).

## What are "servers"?
Mastodon is a lot like email, in that you can get an account on any server and still be able to talk to
anyone else. Actually, Mastodon is part of a larger network, called the fediverse, that has other things
like a YouTube alternative, or a Reddit alternative. All these other sub-networks can talk freely together
as if it were all a single social network.


## Which server do I join?
Generally, it's mostly about moderation. The admins of the instance make decisions to block individual 
accounts or entire servers. If you begin to distrust your admins, you can simply move to another server
where you feel more comfortable with their moderation.

Community is the other big reason to join a server. Some servers cater to specific topics, especially tight
communities like researchers. While this is mostly not an important aspect, Mastodon has some 
features that allow you to keep tabs on everyone else's activity on the server, so being on a server with
like-minded people can certainly make you feel "closer".


## Why Mastodon?
It doesn't have an algorithm. Since the timeline is in chronological order, applying a new timeline on 
top is seamless. One downside, of course, is that the Mastodon network is much smaller than most other
social media networks.
